## Description
This project currently tracks real time buses using data from MBTA. This page updates the buses location every 15 seconds. The red and blue bus icons represent opposite directions of travel on the road. 

## How to Run 
Download a copy of the Real-Time-Bus-Tracker repo. Drag and drop "mapanimation.html" onto a blank webpage and load the page. You should see a map with blue and red bus icons. Wait 15 seconds to see the buses update.

## Roadmap
The future outcome from this project is to add other bus routes with their corresponding icon and color.
