# Eyes
Exercise on Eyes
<img src= "Eyes.png" width='300'/>

## Description
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how mouse events can be a way to bind the DOM elements to events. This eyes exercise uses html and CSS styles to create a set of eyes in the middle of the screen. There is code to track the userâ€™s mouse input and to have the eyes follow wherever the cursor is located on the web page.

## How To Run 
Download a copy of the Eyes repo. Drag and drop index.html onto a blank webpage and load the page. You should see two eyes in the center of the page. Move your cursor around the eyes and the pupils will follow.

## Roadmap
The future outcome from this project is to have the pupils of the eyes appear "cross-eyed" when the cursor is in between the eyes.
